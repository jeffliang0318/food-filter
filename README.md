# Food-Filter

**Food-Filter is a project aiming to find food items based off of the user's own preference**

## Background and Overview

Individuals with restricted diets or have many allergies will often spend time going through the ingredients of products to figure out if they are able to consume it. Our project aims to highlight these ingredients that they cannot consume but also helps the user find a quick and easy way for them to verify it. Our audience includes those with a restricted diet or those with food allergies.
